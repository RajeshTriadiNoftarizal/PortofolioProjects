The dataset includes trip data for the year 2022, segmented into monthly trip data tables. It contains information about ride IDs, rideable types, start and end timestamps, station names and IDs, geospatial coordinates, and member types (annual members or casual riders).

## Data Preparation
The process involved combining monthly trip data tables, handling missing values, and creating calculated columns to enhance the dataset for analysis.

## Data Cleaning
Duplicates and missing values were addressed to ensure the integrity of the dataset. Duplicate rides were retained to maintain user interaction patterns, while missing values were managed based on their impact on the analysis.

## Analysis
The SQL queries conducted on the prepared and cleaned dataset focused on identifying ride frequency trends, hourly usage patterns, total rides by rider type, ride duration, and day of the week analysis.

## Visualizations
Tableau was used to create various visualizations to represent the analyzed data. You can explore the interactive dashboard created using Tableau Public by following the link below:
