# Tesla Supercharger Network Analysis

This repository contains the SQL queries and Tableau visualizations for the Tesla Supercharger Network Analysis project. The goal of this project is to analyze the Tesla Supercharger Network dataset using SQL and present the findings through interactive visualizations in Tableau.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the Tesla Supercharger Network dataset, which can be obtained from Kaggle. You can download the dataset from the following link: [Tesla Supercharger Network Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omarsobhy14/supercharge-locations).

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Data Cleaning - TeslaSupercharger.sql`: This file contains the SQL queries used for data cleaning and preparation of the Tesla Supercharger Network dataset.
- `Exploratory Data Analysis - TeslaSupercharger.sql`: This file contains the SQL queries used for exploratory data analysis to uncover insights and patterns within the Tesla Supercharger Network dataset.
- `Tesla Supercharger Networks.twbx`: This Tableau workbook contains the interactive visualizations created based on the analyzed data. You can access the visualizations on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/) using the following link: [Tesla Supercharger Networks](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rajesh.triadi.noftarizal/viz/TeslaSuperchargerNetworks/Dashboard2).

## Instructions

To explore the project, follow these steps:

1. Download the Tesla Supercharger Network dataset from the provided Kaggle link.
2. Execute the SQL queries in the `Data Cleaning - TeslaSupercharger.sql` file to clean and prepare the dataset.
3. Execute the SQL queries in the `Exploratory Data Analysis - TeslaSupercharger.sql` file to perform exploratory analysis on the dataset.
4. Open the `Tesla Supercharger Networks.twbx` Tableau workbook to interact with the visualizations.

Feel free to explore the SQL queries for data cleaning and exploratory analysis, as well as the Tableau visualizations, in this repository to gain insights into the Tesla Supercharger Network data.
