# WHO Suicide Statistics Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the World Health Organization (WHO) suicide statistics dataset from 1979 to 2016. The dataset provides insights into suicide rates based on age, gender, and year. This README provides an overview of the project, its goals, methodology, key findings, and data source.

## Project Description

This project aims to explore the WHO suicide statistics dataset and gain insights into suicide trends across different age groups, genders, and years. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visualizations to uncover patterns and trends.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and includes suicide statistics from 1979 to 2016. It contains information on suicide rates, age groups, genders, and years. You can access the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/szamil/who-suicide-statistics).

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. Handle missing values, convert data types, and calculate suicide rates.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Explore trends in suicide rates over different years, age groups, and genders. Identify high-risk groups and patterns.

3. **Data Visualization:** Create visualizations, including line charts, bar plots, and scatter plots, to illustrate trends and insights in the data.

## Key Findings

- Suicide rates tend to be higher among older age groups and males.
- Elderly males have the highest suicide rates among all age-gender groups.
- Efforts to raise awareness about mental health are crucial, especially among vulnerable populations.

## Conclusion

The analysis of the WHO suicide statistics dataset highlights the importance of addressing mental health and suicide prevention efforts, particularly among high-risk groups. Understanding the patterns and trends in suicide rates provides valuable insights for creating effective intervention strategies.
